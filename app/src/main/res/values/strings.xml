    <string name="history_text">The earliest hip hop music was performed live, at house parties and block party events, and it was not recorded. Prior to 1979, recorded hip hop music consisted mainly of PA system soundboard recordings of live party shows and early hip hop mixtapes by DJs. Puerto Rican DJ Disco Wiz is credited as the first hip hop DJ to create a \"mixed plate,\" or mixed dub recording, when, in 1977, he combined sound bites, special effects and paused beats to technically produce a sound recording. The first hip hop record is widely regarded to be The Sugarhill Gang\'s \"Rapper\'s Delight\", from 1979. It was the first hip hop record to gain widespread popularity in the mainstream and was where hip hop music got its name from. However, much controversy surrounds this assertion as some regard the March 1979 single \"King Tim III  \" by The Fatback Band, as a rap record. There are various other claimants for the title of first hip hop record. \n\nBy the early 1980s, all the major elements and techniques of the hip hop genre were in place, and by 1982, the electronic   sound had become the trend on the street and in dance clubs. New York City radio station WKTU featured Warp 9\'s \"Nunk,\" in a commercial to promote the station\'s signature sound of emerging hip hop Though not yet mainstream, hip hop had begun to permeate the music scene outside of New York City; it could be found in cities as diverse as Los Angeles, Atlanta, Chicago, Washington, D.C., Baltimore, Dallas, Kansas City, San Antonio, Miami, Seattle, St. Indeed, \"Funk You Up\"  , the first hip hop record released by a female group, and the second single released by Sugar Hill Records, was performed by The Sequence, a group from Columbia, South Carolina which featured Angie Stone. Despite the genre\'s growing popularity, Philadelphia was, for many years, the only city whose contributions could be compared to New York City\'s. Hip hop music became popular in Philadelphia in the late 1970s. The New York Times had dubbed Philadelphia the \"Graffiti Capital of the World\" in 1971. Philadelphia native DJ Lady B recorded \"To the Beat Y\'All\" in 1979, and became the first female solo hip hop artist to record music. Schoolly D, starting in 1984 and also from Philadelphia, began creating a style that would later be known as gangsta rap.

    <string name="new_school_hip_hop">The new school of hip hop was the second wave of hip hop music, originating in 1983–84 with the early records of Run-D.M.C. and LL Cool J. As with the hip hop preceding it (which subsequently became known as old school hip hop), the new school came predominantly from New York City. The new school was initially characterized in form by drum machine-led minimalism, with influences from rock music, a hip hop \"metal music for the 80s–a hard-edge ugly/beauty trance as desperate and stimulating as New York itself.\" It was notable for taunts and boasts about rapping, and socio-political commentary, both delivered in an aggressive, self-assertive style. In image as in song its artists projected a tough, cool, street b-boy attitude.
\n\n
These elements contrasted sharply with much of the previous funk- and disco-influenced hip hop groups, whose music was often characterized by novelty hits, live bands, synthesizers, and \"party rhymes\" (not all artists prior to 1983–84 had these styles). New school artists made shorter songs that could more easily gain radio play, and they produced more cohesive LP albums than their old school counterparts. By 1986, their releases began to establish the hip-hop album as a fixture of mainstream music. Hip hop music became commercially successful, as exemplified by the Beastie Boys\' 1986 album Licensed to Ill, which was the first rap album to hit No. 1 on the Billboard charts.</string>

    <string name = "golden_age_of_hip_hop"><![CDATA[
        Hip hop\'s \"golden age\"   is a name given to a period in mainstream hip hop, produced between the mid-1980s and the mid-1990s, which is characterized by its diversity, quality, innovation and influence. There were strong themes of Afrocentrism and political militancy in golden age hip hop lyrics. The music was experimental and the sampling drew on eclectic sources. There was often a strong jazz influence in the music. The artists and groups most often associated with this phase are Public Enemy, Boogie Down Productions, Eric B.& Rakim, De La Soul, A Tribe Called Quest, Gang Starr, Big Daddy Kane and the Jungle Brothers. The golden age is noted for its innovation a time \"when it seemed that every new single reinvented the genre\" according to Rolling Stone. Referring to \"hip-hop in its golden age\", Spin\'s editor-in-chief Sia Michel says, \"there were so many important, groundbreaking albums coming out right about that time\", and MTV\'s Sway Calloway adds: \"The thing that made that era so great is that nothing was contrived. Everything was still being discovered and everything was still innovative and new\". Writer William Jelani Cobb says \"what made the era they inaugurated worthy of the term golden was the sheer number of stylistic innovations that came into existence…in these golden years, a critical mass of mic prodigies were literally creating themselves and their art form at the same time\". \n\nThe golden age spans \"from approximately 1986 to 1997\", according to Carl Stoffers of New York Daily News. In their article \"In Search of the Golden Age Hip-Hop Sound\", music theorists Ben Duinker and Denis Martin of Empirical Musicology Review use \"the 11 years between and including 1986 and 1996 as chronological boundaries\" to define the golden age, beginning with the releases of Run-DMC\'s Raising Hell and the Beastie Boys\' Licensed to Ill, and ending with the deaths of Tupac Shakur and the Notorious B.I.G.. The Boombox writer Todd \"Stereo\" Williams also cites the May 1986 release of Raising Hell (which sold more than three million copies) as the start of the period and notes that over the next year other important albums were released to success, including Licensed to Ill, Boogie Down Productions\' Criminal Minded  , Public Enemy\'s Yo! Bum Rush the Show  , and Eric B.& Rakim\'s Paid in Full. Williams views this development as the beginning of hip hop\'s own \"album era\" from the late 1980s to the late 1990s, during which hip hop albums earned an unprecedented critical recognition and \"would be the measuring stick by which most of the genre\'s greats would be judged\".

        Gangsta rap is a subgenre of hip hop that reflects the violent lifestyles of inner-city American black youths. Gangsta is a non-rhotic pronunciation of the word gangster. The genre was pioneered in the mid-1980s by rappers such as Schoolly D and Ice-T, and was popularized in the later part of the 1980s by groups like N.W.A. What Does It Mean?\", which is often regarded as the first gangsta rap song, which was followed by Ice-T\'s \"6 in the Mornin\'\" in 1986. \n\nA created in the late 1980s and early 1990s, as well as the mainstreaming of G-funk in the mid-1990s, gangsta rap became the most commercially-lucrative subgenre of hip hop. Some gangsta rappers were known for mixing the political and social commentary of political rap with the criminal elements and crime stories found in gangsta rap. N.W. A is the group most frequently associated with the founding of gangsta rap. In the same interview, Ice-T suggested to Philips that the misunderstanding of Cop Killer and the attempts to censor it had racial overtones: \"The Supreme Court says it\'s OK for a white man to burn a cross in public. But nobody wants a black man to write a record about a cop killer\". \n\nThe subject matter inherent in gangsta rap more generally has caused controversy. The problem here is that the White House and wanna-bes like Bill Clinton represent a political system that never intends to deal with inner city urban chaos,\" Sister Souljah told The Times. Due to the influence of Ice-T and N.W. A, gangsta rap is often viewed as a primarily West Coast phenomenon, despite the contributions of East Coast acts like Schoolly D and Boogie Down Productions in shaping the genre.

        In 1990, Public Enemy\'s Fear of a Black Planet was a significant success with music critics and consumers. The album played a key role in hip hop\'s mainstream emergence in 1990, dubbed by Billboard editor Paul Grein as \"the year that rap exploded\". In a 1990 article on its commercial breakthrough, Janice C. Thompson of Time wrote that hip hop \"has grown into the most exciting development in American pop music in more than a decade\". Thompson noted the impact of Public Enemy\'s 1989 single \"Fight the Power\", rapper Tone L c\'s single Wild Thing being the best-selling single of 1989, and that at the time of her article, nearly a third of the songs on the Billboard Hot 100 were hip hop songs. In a similar 1990 article, Robert Hilburn of the Los Angeles Times put hip hop music\'s commercial emergence into perspective: It was 10 years ago that the Sugarhill Gang\'s \"Rapper\'s Delight\" became the first rap single to enter the national Top 20. \n\nWho ever figured then that the music would even be around in 1990, much less produce attractions that would command as much pop attention as Public Enemy and N.W. A? \"Rapper\'s Delight\" was a novelty record that was considered by much of the pop community simply as a lightweight offshoot of disco and that image stuck for years. Occasional records including Grandmaster Flash\'s \"The Message\" in 1982 and Run-DMC\'s \"It\'s Like That\" in 1984 won critical approval, but rap, mostly, was dismissed as a passing fancy too repetitious, too one dimensional. Yet rap did not go away, and an explosion of energy and imagination in the late 1980s leaves rap today as arguably the most vital new street-oriented sound in pop since the birth of rock in the 1950s.

    <string name = "east_vs_west_rivalry">
        The East Coast–West Coast hip hop rivalry was a feud from 1991 to 1997 between artists and fans of the East Coast hip hop and West Coast hip hop scenes in the United States, especially from 1994 to 1997. Focal points of the feud were East Coast-based rapper The Notorious B.I.G. (and his New York-based label, Bad Boy Records) and West Coast-based rapper Tupac Shakur, (and his Los Angeles-based label), Death Row Records).This rivalry started before the rappers themselves hit the scene. Because New York is the birthplace of hip-hop, artists from the West Coast felt as if they were not receiving the same media coverage and public attention as the East Coast. As time went on both rappers began to grow in fame and as they both became more known the tensions continued to arise. Eventually both artists were fatally shot following drive-by shootings by unknown assailants in 1997 and 1996, respectively.
    </string>

    <string name = "east_coast_hip_hop">
        In the early 1990s East Coast hip hop was dominated by the Native Tongues posse, which was loosely composed of De La Soul with producer Prince Paul, A Tribe Called Quest, the Jungle Brothers, as well as their loose affiliates 3rd Bass, Main Source, and the less successful Black Sheep and KMD. In 1993, the Wu-Tang Clan\'s Enter the Wu-Tang   revitalized the New York hip hop scene by pioneering an East Coast hardcore rap equivalent in intensity to what was being produced on the West Coast. According to Allmusic, the production on two Mobb Deep albums, The Infamous   and Hell on Earth  , are \"indebted\" to RZA\'s early production with the Wu-Tang Clan. The success of albums such as Nas\'s Illmatic and Notorious B.I.G.\'s Ready to Die in 1994 cemented the status of the East Coast during a time of West Coast dominance. \n\nIn a March 2002 issue of The Source Magazine, Nas referred to 1994 as \"a renaissance of New York [City] Hip-Hop\". The productions of RZA, particularly for the Wu-Tang Clan, became influential with artists such as Mobb Deep due to the combination of somewhat detached instrumental loops, highly compressed and processed drums, and gangsta lyrical content. Wu-Tang solo albums such as Raekwon the Chef\'s Only Built 4 Cuban Linx, Ghostface Killah\'s Ironman, and GZA\'s Liquid Swords are now viewed as classics along with Wu-Tang \"core\" material. Producers such as DJ Premier (primarily for Gang Starr but also for other affiliated artists, such as Jeru the Damaja), Pete Rock (with CL Smooth, and supplying beats for many others), Buckwild, Large Professor, Diamond D, and Q-Tip supplied beats for numerous MCs at the time, regardless of location. The rivalry between the East Coast and the West Coast rappers eventually turned personal. Later in the decade the business acumen of the Bad Boy Records tested itself against Jay-Z and his Roc-A-Fella Records and, on the West Coast, Death Row Records. \n\nThe mid to late 1990s saw a generation of rappers such as the members of D.I.T.C.such as the late Big L and Big Pun. On the East Coast, although the \"big business\" end of the market dominated matters commercially the late 1990s to early 2000s saw a number of relatively successful East Coast indie labels such as Rawkus Records (with whom Mos Def and Talib Kweli garnered success) and later Def Jux. The history of the two labels is intertwined, the latter having been started by EL-P of Company Flow in reaction to the former, and offered an outlet for more underground artists such as Mike Ladd, Aesop Rock, Mr Lif, RJD2, Cage and Cannibal Ox. Other acts such as the Hispanic Arsonists and slam poet turned MC Saul Williams met with differing degrees of success.

        After N.W.A. broke up, former member Dr. Dre released The Chronic in 1992, which peaked at No. 1 on the R-n-B/hip hop chart,[151] No. 3 on the pop chart, and spawned a No. 2 pop single with \"Nuthin\' but a \'G\' Thang\". The Chronic took West Coast rap in a new direction, influenced strongly by P funk artists, melding smooth and easy funk beats with slowly-drawled lyrics. This came to be known as G-funk and dominated mainstream hip hop in the early-mid 1990s through a roster of artists on Suge Knight\'s Death Row Records, including Tupac Shakur, whose double disc album All Eyez on Me was a big hit with hit songs \"Ambitionz az a Ridah\" and \"2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted\";[citation needed] and Snoop Doggy Dogg, whose Doggystyle included the top ten hits \"What\'s My Name?\" and \"Gin and Juice\".[153] As the Los Angeles-based Death Row built an empire around Dre, Snoop, and Tupac, it also entered into a rivalry with New York City\'s Bad Boy Records, led by Puff Daddy and The Notorious B.I.G..\n\n
Detached from this scene were other artists such as Freestyle Fellowship and The Pharcyde, as well as more underground artists such as the Solesides collective (DJ Shadow and Blackalicious amongst others), Jurassic 5, Ugly Duckling, People Under The Stairs, Tha Alkaholiks, and earlier Souls of Mischief, who represented a return to hip hop\'s roots of sampling and well-planned rhyme schemes.

    <string name = "bling_era">
        During the late 1990s, in the wake of the deaths of Tupac Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G., a new commercial sound emerged in the hip hop scene, sometimes referred to as the \"bling era\" (derived from Lil Wayne\'s \"Bling Bling\"), \"jiggy era\" (derived from Will Smith\'s \"Gettin\' Jiggy wit It\"), or \"shiny suit era\" (derived by metallic suits worn by some rappers in music videos at the time, such as in \"Mo Money Mo Problems\" by The Notorious B.I.G., Puff Daddy, and Mase). Before the late 1990s, gangsta rap, while a huge-selling genre, had been regarded as well outside of the pop mainstream, committed to representing the experience of the inner-city and not \"selling out\" to the pop charts. However, the rise of Sean \"Puff Daddy\" Combs\'s Bad Boy Records, propelled by the massive crossover success of Combs\'s 1997 ensemble album No Way Out, signaled a major stylistic change in gangsta rap (and mainstream hip hop in general), as it would become even more commercially successful and popularly accepted.
        \n\n
Silky R-n-B-styled hooks and production, more materialist subject matter, and samples of hit soul and pop songs from the 1970s and 1980s were the staples of this sound, which was showcased by producers such as Combs, Timbaland, The Trackmasters, The Neptunes, and Scott Storch. Also achieving similar levels of success at this time were Master P and his No Limit label in New Orleans; Master P built up a roster of artists   based out of New Orleans, and incorporated G funk and Miami bass influences in his music. Many of the rappers who achieved mainstream success at this time, such as Nelly, Puff Daddy, Jay-Z, the later career of Fat Joe and his Terror Squad, Mase, Ja Rule, Fabolous, and Cam\'ron, had a pop-oriented style, while others such as Big Pun, Fat Joe  , DMX, Eminem, 50 Cent and his G-Unit, and The Game enjoyed commercial success at this time with a grittier style.
        \n\n
Although white rappers like the Beastie Boys, House of Pain, and 3rd Bass previously had some popular success or critical acceptance from the hip hop community, Eminem\'s success, beginning in 1999 with the platinum The Slim Shady LP, surprised many. Dre remained an important figure in this era, making his comeback in 1999 with the album 2001. In 2000, he produced The Marshall Mathers LP by Eminem, and also produced 50 Cent\'s 2003 album Get Rich or Die Tryin\', which debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 charts.
        \n\nJay-Z represented the cultural triumph of hip hop in this era. As his career progressed, he went from performing artist to entrepreneur, label president, head of a clothing line, club owner, and market consultant along the way breaking Elvis Presley\'s record for most number one albums on the Billboard magazine charts by a solo artist.

    <string name = "alternate_hip_hop">
        Alternative hip hop, which was introduced in the 1980s and then declined, resurged in the early-mid 2000s with the rejuvenated interest in indie music by the general public. The genre began to attain a place in the mainstream, due in part to the crossover success of artists such as OutKast, Kanye West, and Gnarls Barkley. OutKast\'s 2003 album Speakerboxxx/The Love Below received high acclaim from music critics, and appealed to a wide range of listeners, being that it spanned numerous musical genres including rap, rock, R-n-B, punk, jazz, indie, country, pop, electronica, and gospel. The album also spawned two number-one hit singles, and has been certified diamond by selling 11 times platinum by the RIAA for shipping more than 11 million units, becoming one of the best selling hip-hop albums of all-time. It also won a Grammy Award for Album of the Year at the 46th Annual Grammy Awards, being only the second rap album to do so. Previously, alternative hip hop acts had attained much critical acclaim, but received relatively little exposure through radio and other media outlets; during this time, alternative hip hop artists such as MF Doom, The Roots, Dilated Peoples, Gnarls Barkley, Mos Def, and Aesop Rock began to achieve significant recognition.

    <string name = "glitch_hip_hop_and_wonky_music">
        Glitch hop and wonky music evolved following the rise of trip hop, dubstep and intelligent dance music. Both glitch hop and wonky music frequently reflect the experimental nature of IDM and the heavy bass featured in dubstep songs. While trip hop has been described as being a distinct British upper-middle class take on hip-hop, glitch-hop and wonky music have much more stylistic diversity. Both genres often pay homage to older and more well established electronic music artists such as Radiohead, Aphex Twin and Boards of Canada as well as independent hip hop producers like J Dilla and Madlib. Glitch hop is a fusion genre of hip hop and glitch music that originated in the early to mid-2000s in the United States and Europe. Glitch hop artists include Prefuse 73, Dabrye and Flying Lotus. Wonky is a subgenre of hip hop that originated around 2008, but most notably in the United States and United Kingdom, and among international artists of the Hyperdub music label, under the influence of glitch hop and dubstep. Wonky music is of the same glitchy style as glitch hop, but it was specifically noted for its melodies, rich with \"mid-range unstable synths\". Scotland has become one of the most prominent wonky scenes, with artists like Hudson Mohawke and Rustie. Glitch hop and wonky are popular among a relatively smaller audience interested in alternative hip hop and electronic music  ; neither glitch hop nor wonky have achieved mainstream popularity. However, artists like Flying Lotus, The Glitch Mob and Hudson Mohawke have seen success in other avenues.

    <string name = "crunk_music">
        Crunk is a regional hip hop genre that originated in Tennessee in the southern United States in the 1990s, influenced by Miami bass. One of the pioneers of crunk, Lil Jon, said that it was a fusion of hip hop, electro, and electronic dance music. The style was pioneered and commercialized by artists from Memphis, Tennessee and Atlanta, Georgia, gaining considerable popularity in the mid-2000s via Lil Jon and the Ying Yang Twins. Looped, stripped-down drum machine rhythms are usually used. The Roland TR-808 and 909 are among the most popular. The drum machine loops are usually accompanied by simple, repeated synthesizer melodies and heavy bass \"stabs\". The tempo of the music is somewhat slower than hip-hop, around the speed of reggaeton. The focal point of crunk is more often the beats and instrumental music rather than the lyrics. Crunk rappers, however, often shout and scream their lyrics, creating an aggressive, almost heavy, style of hip-hop. While other subgenres of hip-hop address sociopolitical or personal concerns, crunk is almost exclusively \"party music\", favoring call and response hip-hop slogans in lieu of more substantive approaches. Crunk helped southern hip hop gain mainstream prominence during this period, as the classic East and West Coast styles of the 1990s gradually lost dominance.
    </string>

    <string name = "snap_music">
        Snap rap   is a subgenre of crunk that emerged from Atlanta, Georgia in the late 1990s. The genre gained mainstream popularity in the mid-late 2000s, and artists from other Southern states such as Tennessee also began to emerge performing in this style. Tracks commonly consist of a Roland TR-808 bass drum, hi-hat, bass, finger snapping, a main groove, and a simplistic vocal hook. Hit snap songs include \"Lean wit It, Rock wit It\" by Dem Franchize Boyz, \"Laffy Taffy\" by D4L, \"It\'s Goin\' Down\" by Yung Joc, and \"Crank That  \" by Soulja Boy Tell \'Em. In retrospect, Soulja Boy has been credited with setting trends in hip hop, such as self-publishing his songs through the Internet   and paving the way for a new wave of younger artists.

    <string name = "decline_in_sales">
        Starting in 2005, sales of hip hop music in the United States began to severely wane, leading Time magazine to question if mainstream hip-hop was \"dying\". Billboard magazine found that, since 2000, rap sales dropped 44%, and declined to 10% of all music sales, which, while still a commanding figure when compared to other genres, is a significant drop from the 13% of all music sales where rap music regularly placed. According to Courtland Milloy of The Washington Post, for the first time on five years, no rap albums were among the top 10 sellers in 2006. NPR culture critic Elizabeth Blair noted that, \"some industry experts say young people are fed up with the violence, degrading imagery and lyrics\". However, the 2005 report Generation M: Media in the Lives of 8 18 Year-Olds found that hip hop music is by far the most popular music genre for children and teenagers with 65 percent of 8- to-18-year-olds listening to it on a daily basis.
        \n\n
Other journalists say the music is just as popular as it ever was, but that fans have found other means to consume the music, such as illegally downloading music through P2P networks, instead of purchasing albums and singles from legitimate stores. For example, Flo Rida is known for his low album sales regardless of his singles being mainstream and having digital success. His second album R.O.O.T.S.sold only 200,000+ total units in the U.S., which could not line up to the sales of the album\'s lead single \"Right Round\". This also happened to him in 2008. Some put the blame on hip hop becoming less lyrical over time, such as Soulja Boy\'s 2007 debut album souljaboytellem.com which was met with negative reviews. Lack of sampling, a key element of early hip hop, has also been noted for the decrease in quality of modern albums. For example, there are only four samples used in 2008\'s Paper Trail by T.I., while there are 35 samples in 1998\'s Moment of Truth by Gang Starr.
        \n\n
The decrease in sampling is in part due to it being too expensive for producers. In Byron Hurt\'s documentary Hip Hop: Beyond Beats and Rhymes, he claims that hip hop had changed from \"clever rhymes and dance beats\" to \"advocating personal, social and criminal corruption\". Despite the fall in record sales throughout the music industry, hip-hop has remained a popular genre, with hip-hop artists still regularly topping the Billboard 200 Charts. In the first half of 2009 alone artists such as Eminem, Rick Ross, The Black Eyed Peas, and Fabolous all had albums that reached the No. Eminem\'s album Relapse was one of the fastest selling albums of 2009.

    <string name="innovation_and_revitalization"><![CDATA[
        By the late 2000s, alternative hip hop had secured its place within the mainstream, due in part to the declining commercial viability of gangsta rap. Industry observers view the sales race between Kanye West\'s Graduation and 50 Cent\'s Curtis as a turning point for hip hop. West emerged the victor, selling nearly a million copies in the first week alone, proving that innovative rap music could be just as commercially viable as gangsta rap, if not more so. Although he designed it as a melancholic pop album rather than a rap album, Kanye\'s following 808s & Heartbreak would have a significant effect on hip hop music. While his decision to sing about love, loneliness, and heartache for the entirety of the album was at first heavily criticized by music audiences and the album was predicted to be a flop, its subsequent critical acclaim and commercial success encouraged other mainstream rappers to take greater creative risks with their music. During the release of The Blueprint 3, New York rap mogul Jay-Z revealed that next studio album would be an experimental effort, stating, \"…it\'s not gonna be a #1 album. I wanna make the most experimental album I ever made\". Jay-Z elaborated that like Kanye, he was unsatisfied with contemporary hip hop, was being inspired by indie-rockers like Grizzly Bear, and asserted his belief that the indie rock movement would play an important role in the continued evolution of hip-hop.
        \n\n
The alternative hip hop movement was not limited only to the United States, as rappers such as Somali-Canadian poet K\'naan, Japanese rapper Shing02, and Sri Lankan British artist M.I.A.achieved considerable worldwide recognition. A in the Time 100 list of \"World\'s Most Influential people\" for having \"global influence across many genres\". Global-themed movements have also sprung out of the international hip-hop scene with microgenres like \"Islamic Eco-Rap\" addressing issues of worldwide importance through traditionally disenfranchised voices.
        \n\n
Due in part to the increasing use of music distribution through social media and blogging, many alternative and non-alternative rappers found acceptance by far-reaching audiences, hence why this era of hip hop is sometimes termed the \"blog era\". Several artists, such as Kid Cudi and Drake, managed to attain chart-topping hit songs, \"Day \'n\' Nite\" and \"Best I Ever Had\" respectively, by releasing their music on free online mixtapes without the help of a major record label. Emerging artists at the time such as Wale, Kendrick Lamar, J. B were noted by critics as expressing eclectic sounds, sensitive life experiences, and vulnerable emotions that were rarely seen in the prior bling era. \n\n Also at this time, the Auto-Tune vocal effect was bolstered in popularity by rapper T-Pain, who elaborated on the effect and made active use of Auto-Tune in his songs.He cites new jack swing producer Teddy Riley and funk artist Roger Troutman\'s use of the Talk Box as inspirations for his own use of Auto-Tune. T-Pain became so associated with Auto-Tune that he had an iPhone App named after him that simulated the effect, called \"I Am T-Pain\". Eventually dubbed the \"T-Pain effect\", the use of Auto-Tune became a popular fixture of late 2000s and early 2010s hip hop, examples being Snoop Dogg\'s \"Sexual Eruption\", Lil Wayne\'s \"Lollipop\", Kanye West\'s album 808s & Heartbreak, and The Black Eyed Peas\' number-one hit \"Boom Boom Pow\".

    <string name="mumble_rap">
        Trap music is a subgenre of Southern rap that originated in the early 1990s. It grew in the 2000s to become a mainstream sensation, eventually reaching ubiquity in the mid-late 2010s and frequently having songs top the Billboard hip hop charts. It is typified by double or triple-time sub-divided hi-hats, heavy kick drums from the Roland TR-808 drum machine, layered synthesizers and an overall dark, ominous or bleak atmosphere. The strong influence of the sound led to other artists within the genre to move towards the trap sound, with a notable example being Jay-Z and Kanye West on their joint song, \"H A M\". Other artists not within the hip hop genre have also experimented with trap, such as \"7/11\" by Beyonc and \"Dark Horse\" by Katy Perry featuring Juicy J.
        \n\n
Major artists to arise from the genre in the 2010s include Waka Flocka Flame, Future, Chief Keef, Migos, Young Thug, Travis Scott, Kodak Black, 21 Savage, Yung Lean, Lil Uzi Vert, XXXTentacion, Ski Mask the Slump God, Juice Wrld, Trippie Redd, Lil Pump, Smokepurpp, Rae Sremmurd, Tekashi 6ix9ine, NBA YoungBoy, Lil Baby, Fetty Wap, among others. Female rappers Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion also entered the mainstream. Trap artists that originated in the 2000s were able to recapture mainstream success in the 2010s with the rise of trap, including 2 Chainz, Gucci Mane and Juicy J, becoming more successful in the latter part of their career than when they debuted. Trap producers to reach mainstream success include Metro Boomin, Pi\'erre Bourne, London on da Track, and Mike WiLL Made-It.
        \n\n
Critics of the trap genre have used the term \"mumble rap\" to describe the heavily auto-tuned, and sometimes hard to understand, delivery of verses from a majority of the artists. Artists longstanding within the genre have had their own comments regarding the rise of mumble rap, such as Rick Rubin stating that Eminem was confused by it, and Snoop Dogg claiming that he cannot differentiate between artists. Black Thought, lead rapper from The Roots, stated that the \"game has changed. It\'s different. The standards are different, the criteria that\'s taken into consideration in determining validity is different. We are at a point in history where lyricism almost comes last in very many regards\".

On July 17, 2017, Forbes reported that hip-hop/R-n-B (which Nielsen SoundScan classifies as being the same genre) had usurped rock as the most consumed musical genre, becoming the most popular genre in music for the first time in U.S.history.

        The rise of streaming platforms such as Spotify and Apple Music in the mid-late 2010s greatly impacted the entire music business as a whole. Despite being a free streaming-only mixtape with no commercial release, Chance the Rapper\'s Coloring Book won Best Rap Album at the 2017 Grammy Awards, being the first streaming album ever to win a Grammy Award. Kanye West has stated that his own album, Yeezus, marked the death of CDs, and thus his subsequent release, The Life of Pablo was only released digitally. The Life of Pablo was also nominated for 2017 Best Rap Album. In 2017, Drake released a free streaming-only project titled More Life, which he called a \"playlist\", insisting that it was neither a mixtape nor an album.

The online audio distribution platform SoundCloud played a massive role in the creation of various artists\' careers in the latter half of the 2010s. Mainstream acts to start on SoundCloud include Post Malone, Lil Uzi Vert, Russ, Bryson Tiller, Lil Xan, Lil Pump, Lil Peep, Lil Skies, Smokepurpp, Ski Mask the Slump God, XXXTentacion, Trippie Redd, Playboi Carti, YBN Nahmir, Tay-K, ZillaKami, Ugly God, NAV among others. These songs are usually closely related to trap, but have also been labeled separately as SoundCloud rap. They have been characterized as usually having moody, sad undertones, and usually feature lo-fi rough production. The genre has been met with much criticism for its low effort in lyrics and production, and the problematic nature of the artists to arise from it, such as Lil Peep\'s drug abuse that led to his death, the multiple assault charges to XXXTentacion, 6ix9ine pleading guilty to using a child in a sexual performance, and the murder charges on Tay-K.

    Now, this is quite subjective topic, as everyone got their own top 10s, top 5s and everyone is right in their own perspective.

    We cannot say that this list is correct and other is wrong. Some might be fond of beats, flow, etc. where as others may lean towards lyrics, rhymes more when they hear something.
        So what we have done here is we have presented you some lists made by different websites and critics.
